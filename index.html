      <p><span class="name-1">Grid.</span> <span class="name-2">Fluid Layout.</span> <span class="name-3">Responsive Grid.</span> <span class="name-4">Flexible Grid.</span> Whatever you want to call it, there are SO MANY of them to choose from. How could you ever find the <em>right one</em>?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, I won't tell you which is the greatest, most awesomest grid for your website. Mainly because I don't know. What I have done is compiled a collection of grids from all over the internet. Some you've probably heard of, others you probably have not.</p>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Take a look around and hopefully this helps ease your pain of picking a grid...</p>
